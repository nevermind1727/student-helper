## Project Description
This is the Student Helper project that I have built from the
ground up. This application can help you if you are studying in school or university. 
<br>
This allows you to save time on solving routine tasks.
Student Helper provides you 3 main services: Study Notes Creator, Grammar Correction, Essay Generator. Let's look at each one in more detail.

### Study Notes Creator
You need to specify the number of key points and the topic, then OpenAI will generate study notes based on your prompt. 
This is very useful when you need to briefly learn the main aspects of a certain topic.
<br>
### Grammar Correction
You can provide text/sentence/word and this service will correct grammatical errors in the prompt, if there are any. 
This is very useful when you are not sure that you wrote a sentence correctly, or for example to check the text for grammatical errors.
<br>
### Essay Generator
You can use this service in order to create an whole essay with certain amount of sentences on the particular subject.
In my opinion, an essay is a thing that a student should write on his own 
to demonstrate his point of view, but sometimes there are situations, for example,
when the topic of the essay is absolutely not interesting or you do not have enough time to write it out, 
in those cases this service will be useful for you.
